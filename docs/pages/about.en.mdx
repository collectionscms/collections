      AI has fundamentally changed how people search for information. Today, customer journeys begin
      not with keywords but with questions. Consumers expect answers across various channels—search,
      chat, and voice—in multiple languages, and AI delivers by recommending the most relevant
      content based on search intent.
    </div>
    <div className="text-lg leading-loose mt-4">
      In this "Ask AI" era, a website that cannot respond to consumer questions risks losing its
      value. Optimizing content for AI-driven searches has become an essential priority that can no
      longer be overlooked.

    <div className="text-lg leading-loose mt-4">
      Collections harnesses this shift to help businesses capture global potential customers. By
      enabling multilingual content management and AI-powered assistance, it accelerates website
      globalization. Moving forward, it will continue to evolve as a CMS that aligns with the
      advancements in AI-driven search.

      What makes content valuable to the reader? This is the question that guided our thinking.
    </div>
    <div className="text-lg leading-loose mt-4">
      Content should be short, direct, and easy to understand in the reader's native language. This
      is content that both people and AI desire.
