      AI has fundamentally changed how people search for information. Consumers ask questions through various channels such as search, chat, and voice, expecting clear answers. AI then recommends the best content based on their search intent.
    </div>
    <div className="text-lg leading-loose mt-4">
      In this era of "Ask AI," keywords are becoming less relevant. What matters most are websites that provide clear answers to consumers' questions in their native language.
    </div>
    <div className="text-lg leading-loose mt-4">
      Collections, a multilingual CMS, streamlines and accelerates the globalization of existing websites with greater speed and simplicity. Moving forward, it will continue to evolve as a CMS that aligns with the
      advancements in AI-driven search.

    <div className="text-lg leading-loose mt-4">
      Content should be short, direct, and easy to understand in the reader's native language. This
      is content that both people and AI desire.
