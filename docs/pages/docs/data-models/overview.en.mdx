# Overview

> The Collections data model provides no-code configuration and management for any SQL database. You control not only the configuration of tables, columns, and relationships, but also how users view and manipulate data.

## Databases

Collections is an SQL database wrapper. A database is a collection of data stored in a computer in a structured manner, and the specific way it is structured is called a data model.

## Types of Relationships

Collections provides one method for relation-linking tables.

- **One to Many** â€” Each row in a data table can be linked to many rows in another data table.
  Note: In the data model, Many-to-One Relationship and One-to-Many Relationship mean the same thing.
