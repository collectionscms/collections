# Data type

> There are two types of data types: list and single object. Whichever you choose, you can change it later.

## List type

List type can handle multiple pieces of data at once. The response is returned in an array similar to the following

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "age": 30
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "name": "Jane Doe",
      "age": 24
    }
  ]
}
```

## Single object type

Single object type can handle only one piece of data. The response is returned in an object similar to the following.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "1",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30
  }
}
```
