# Publish Status

> Publish status can be enabled during data model creation. Depending on the publication status set, it will determine if the data rows will be included in the API response.

## Publish Status Fields

A `status` field is created by default. It is referenced from the `statusField` in the data model, and its value can be changed later.

## Field Value

By default, `draft`, `published`, and `archived` are created. There are referenced by `draftValue`, `publishedValue`, and `archivedValue` in the data model and can be changed later.

Even if such a data line is stored

| id  |    title |    status |
| :-- | -------: | --------: |
| 1   | article1 |     draft |
| 2   | article2 | published |
| 3   | article3 |   drafted |

In fact, the response is as follows

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 2,
      "title": "article2",
      "status": "published"
    }
  ]
}
```
