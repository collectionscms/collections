# Amazon Lightsail

> This is a guide to deploying Collections projects on AWS Lightsail. This guide uses Let's Encrypt certificates to optimize costs.

Amazon Lightsail Installation Requirements

- You must have an [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free) account before performing the following steps.

<Steps>
### Create a Lightsail instance

Log in to [Amazon Lightsail](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/?pg=ln&cp=bn) and create an instance of the following environment

- Linux/Unix + Nginx
- 2 GM RAM

<Callout type="warning">
  Collections requires at least 2GB of RAM to build and deploy the management interface.
</Callout>

  />
</p>

### Attach a static IP address

The IP address attached to a Lightsail instance is dynamic and changes each time the instance is restarted. Refer to the [official AWS documentation](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/ja_jp/articles/lightsail-create-static-ip) to attach a static IP address.
After attaching, also make sure that the welcome page is displayed by accessing the static IP address.

### Routing your own domain

Once the static IP address is attached, refer to the [official AWS documentation](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/ja_jp/articles/lightsail-how-to-create-dns-entry) to find the ` example.com` or other domain name to route to your Amazon Lightsail instance.

Alternatively, if your domain is already hosted on Route53, create an A record and specify a static IP address.

</p>

### SSL certificates are issued and integrated into the instance

Enhance the security of your website and applications with SSL/TLS. Refer to [official AWS documentation](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/ja_jp/articles/lightsail-how-to-create-dns-entry) to issue a Let's Encrypt certificate and integrate it into your instance, Integrate it into your instance.

### Install Node.js

Access Lightsail via console and install Node.js.

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.0/install.sh | bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm install --lts
```

### Install Collections

Now it is time to install the application. First, go to the Nginx root directory, then run Collections installation.

```bash
cd /home/bitnami/stack/nginx/html
npx create-collections-app collections
```

### Configure Nginx

Edit the Nginx configuration file and set Collections to the root directory. Here the domain name is `collections.dev`.

```
server {
    root /home/bitnami/stack/nginx/html/collections;
    include "/opt/bitnami/nginx/conf/bitnami/*.conf";

    server_name collections.dev app.collections.dev;

    location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:4000;
    }

    listen [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on; # managed by Certbot
    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/collections.dev/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/collections.dev/privkey.pem;

    location /status {
        stub_status on;
        access_log off;
        allow 127.0.0.1;
        deny all;
    }
}

server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;

    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

### Build the application

```
cd /home/bitnami/stack/nginx/html/collections
npm run build
```

### Running Applications on PM2

PM2 can keep Node.js processes running at all times and reload them without downtime.
Run the following command to install PM2 globally.

```
npm install pm2@latest -g
```

Then, start PM2.

```
pm2 start /home/bitnami/stack/nginx/html/collections/dist/build/main.js --name collections
```

### Restart

Finally, restart the basic service to reflect the changes.

```
sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh restart
```

</Steps>
