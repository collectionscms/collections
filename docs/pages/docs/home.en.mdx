# Welcome to Collections

> These documents describe the core concepts that make Collections unique.

## What is Collections?

Collections is a headless CMS that allows you to embed dynamic multilingual content—such as blogs, announcements, and notifications—into your website. From post creation and automatic translation to AI-driven SEO optimization, we can quickly transform your existing site into **a global multilingual site**.

## What is headless?

This architecture separates the front end from the back end. Unlike integrated CMSs like WordPress or Wix, it doesn’t include a built-in content delivery interface. As a result, content creators need to build their sites by combining the APIs provided by the headless CMS with their own front-end framework.

## Advantages of Headless

A headless CMS delivers an optimal user experience with its custom front end. When combined with Collections, you can easily create a multilingual site from scratch or transform **an existing site to support multiple languages!**
