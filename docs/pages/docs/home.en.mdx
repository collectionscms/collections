# Welcome to Collections

> These documents describe the core concepts that make Collections unique.

## What is Collections?

Collections is a headless content management system (CMS) that allows you to API your WordPress articles by simply dragging and dropping them.
You can create articles from the submission screen, model new tables, and expand your content at will.

## What is headless?

It is an architecture that separates the front-end from the back-end.

Compared to an integrated, monolithic CMS such as WordPress, Collections **does not have a screen to deliver content**.
Therefore, content distributors need to build with another application using the APIs provided by Collections.

## Advantages of Introduction

Combined with its own front end, it can **provide a high user experience**. The separation of the system also makes it easy to maintain and port the UI.

Collections is not limited to CMS. it can be used as a backend for web applications. In the future, we will focus on collaboration with various software.
Please let us know what you would like to see in Collections.
