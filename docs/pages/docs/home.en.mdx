# Welcome to Collections

> These documents describe the core concepts that make Collections unique.

## What is Collections?

Collections is a headless CMS that allows you to embed dynamic multilingual content—such as blogs, announcements, and notifications—into your website. From post creation and automatic translation to AI-driven SEO optimization, we can quickly transform your existing site into **a global multilingual site**.

## What is headless?

This architecture separates the front end from the back end. Unlike traditional CMS systems, it doesn’t include a built-in interface to present content. Instead, the API provided by the headless CMS can be integrated with a custom front end to deliver an optimized user experience.

## Advantages of Headless

Content created with Collections can be embedded into existing sites or WordPress, allowing you to make your site multilingual without the need for a major migration!
