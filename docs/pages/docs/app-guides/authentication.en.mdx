# Authentication

> All data in the platform is private by default; you can access private data by passing an access token to the API.

## Introduction

Collections provides a REST API to manage data in the database; the API relies on standard HTTP status codes and uses JSON for input and output.

## Access Tokens

There are two types of tokens that can be used to authenticate Collections.

**Temporary Token (JWT)** are returned by the login endpoint as `token`. These tokens have a relatively short expiration date and are the safest to use.
A `refreshToken` is returned with the `token` and can be used by the refresh endpoint to obtain a new token.

**API key** can be set per platform user and do not expire. Although insecure, it is very useful for server-to-server communication.
API keys are stored in plain text in `CollectionsUsers.apiKey`.

Once you have your access token, there are two ways to pass it to the API, via the `access_token` query parameter, or in the request's Authorization Header.

### Query Parameter

```
?access_token=<token>
```

### Authorization Header

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
