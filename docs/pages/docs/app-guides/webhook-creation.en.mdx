# Webhook Creation

> A webhook is a feature that sends a notification to a specified URL when specific events occur, such as publishing or updating an article. This guide explains the steps to create a webhook, using triggering Vercel’s Deploy Hook as an example.

<Steps>
### Creating a Deploy Hook in Vercel

In Vercel, go to Project Settings > Deploy Hooks to create a new Deploy Hook and obtain its URL.

If you can confirm that publishing an article triggers a build in Vercel, the webhook has been set up correctly.
